## About me

Hello! I am Ash or ProtoMars, and I am a 13 year old self-taught programmer. I work a lot with Roblox, and I enjoy doing backend work.
I've always had a passion for programming, and have loved it since an early age. (i started using scratch when i was about 5 and a half or 6!)
I have a lot of experience with Linux, and have been using it since I was 12. (distro i started with and still use to this day is arch)
I like to make games and Discord bots in my free time. I also am interested in AI and machine learning/algorithms.

I try to make myself available to program whenever I can, and genuinely enjoy my work.
Thank you for your interest!
